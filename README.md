**Link to project:** https://to-do-list-crud.herokuapp.com/

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, MongoDB

This to-do list implements the four main components in a CRUD API. It has the ability to view items on the list, add items, mark items as completed, and delete items. The page also tells you how many items there are left to complete. 

## Lessons Learned:
Building this to-do list helped me understand the core concepts of CRUD APIs. I have a better understanding of how to use Node.js and express to interact with the database, as well as fetching information from the server to use in Javascript. I was also able to improve some front-end skills, such as positioning content using CSS flexbox.
